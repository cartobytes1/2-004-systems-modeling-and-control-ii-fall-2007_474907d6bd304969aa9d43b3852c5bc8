Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

*   Create lumped parameter models (expressed as ODEs) of simple dynamic systems in the electrical and mechanical energy domains
*   Make quantitative estimates of model parameters from experimental measurements
*   Obtain the time-domain response of linear systems to initial conditions and/or common forcing functions (specifically; impulse, step and ramp input) by both analytical and computational methods
*   Obtain the frequency-domain response of linear systems to sinusoidal inputs
*   Compensate the transient response of dynamic systems using feedback techniques
*   Design, implement and test an active control system to achieve a desired performance measure

Mastery of these topics will be assessed via homework, quizzes/exams, and lab assignments.
